# **Enhancing Lunar Surface Images using OpenCV**

A comprehensive project focused on enhancing lunar surface images by leveraging advanced image processing techniques, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), denoising, sharpening, and optional neural network integration. The goal is to create high-definition, realistic visuals suitable for research, mission planning, and educational purposes.

---

## **Features**

- **CLAHE Application**: Improves local contrast and reveals hidden surface structures.
- **Denoising & Sharpening**: Reduces noise while preserving and enhancing key features like craters and ridges.
- **Realism Enhancement**: Refines textures, structures, and colors to closely match real lunar surfaces.
- **Scalability**: Designed for batch processing of large datasets of lunar images.

## **How It Works**

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Converts original images to grayscale for uniform processing.
2. **Contrast Enhancement (CLAHE)**: Enhances visibility in low-light regions.
3. **Noise Reduction & Texture Refinement**: Applies advanced filtering to reduce noise and sharpen key details.
4. **Optional Neural Network Integration**: Uses pre-trained models to refine image textures, fill missing data, and enhance accuracy further.
5. **Output Generation**: Produces enhanced and realistic lunar images ready for analysis.
